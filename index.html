                    <p>The Indian Pandikona is one of the forgotten breeds from Andra Pradesh. The Pandikona is named after the location where it is found. Pandikona is located near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. This highly territorial breed is used
                        to guard villages, property and livestock and to hunt any available game. Their territorial nature and sharp tempers often result in fights with neighbouring dogs that trespass onto its territory. Since Pandikona is a small village
                        with overlapping property boundaries and most homes has 2 to 3 dogs, it is quite natural for dogs to posture and get into occasional squabbles over borders. Most of the squabbles end in one dog retreating and no serious injuries.
                        Villagers do not normally intercede in the dogs territorial battles. </p>

                    <p>These intelligent and independent dog are never chained but roam freely among the village and do not take directions from their owners. They are normally within the vicinity of their property and take their guarding duties seriously.
                        When bored or satisfied with the security of their owners home the dogs will go to the owners farm and continue guarding duties. Ideally suited for guarding or hunting duties the Pandikona is a fierce protector that is tolerant
                        of errant children and young strays but are deadly serious with adults. The Pandikona will normally warn the intruder to stay away but the warning is fleeting and the impending attack carried out swiftly and with great intensity.
                        Adult Pandikona dogs are focused and confident in their abilities to defend and will exercise some judgment when confronted with a young person or juvenile animal. Their hunting function is performed in the traditional way with
                        weapons that have been used for generations. Normally done with a spear or "ballem" which is a sharp metal end affixed to a stick. Hunting in this way exposes the hunter and the dogs to grave danger from boars and other animals.
                        The dogs hunt in packs with a leaders established by pack order and all territorial disagreements are forgotten during the hunt. Typically the leader has the best nose and bite and goes in hunt for the boar with the pack following
                        at a discrete distance. It is said that the pack has a complex communication system which enables the leader to warn the pack of dangers such as snakes, scorpions and if it has found the quarry. If the prey is very large the leader
                        will take the first bite and bring the prey down. If the prey is not very challenging the leader will allow the junior leader to take the first bite and bring the quarry down with the other joining in the kill. Pups join the hunt
                        between 6 and 8 months of age. </p>


                    <p>One of the enthusiastic volunteer(a doctor) was actually speaking to few of the villagers and was told that around 2010, due some dispute in the village, more than 25 hunting dogs were killed due to poisoning overnight. It was done
                        by an elderly egoistic person from the village itself and he concluded that this might be the reason that the height and size of these dogs have come down a bit as the villagers have lost interest in hunting cause of that incident.

                        as an example a dingo being a product of Nature is not going to beat any best of breed domestic working dog at anything, no wild horse is going to win the Cox Plate or be an Olympic Cross Country Racer , simply because Nature creates
